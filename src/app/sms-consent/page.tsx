        <P>
          This page shows exactly how SwiftCard collects consent to send text messages. SwiftCard is a
          digital business card platform operated by <strong>Swift Card Inc</strong> (see our{" "}
          <Link href="/company" className="text-brand underline">Company page</Link>). The full program terms
          are in our <Link href="/sms-terms" className="text-brand underline">SMS &amp; Messaging Terms</Link>{" "}
          and <Link href="/privacy" className="text-brand underline">Privacy Policy</Link>.
        </P>

        <H2>Who sends the messages, and who they go to</H2>
        <P>
          Every SwiftCard user has a public card page (for example,
          swiftcard.me/their-name). People they meet share their contact details with them — in person,
          at an event, or through the &quot;Share your info&quot; form on that card page. Sharing contact
          details is not a subscription to text messages, and SwiftCard does not treat it as one: a
          contact captured that way is never sent an automated text.
        </P>

        <H2>How consent is obtained</H2>
        <P>
          Consent is given to the SwiftCard user, by the person they met, in the conversation where
          they exchanged details — the same permission any professional asks for before texting
          someone. SwiftCard does not text anyone on its own behalf and never markets to these contacts.
        </P>
        <ul className="mb-3">
          <LI>
            A SwiftCard user opens a contact in their Contacts list and sets up a text follow-up for
            that one person.
          </LI>
          <LI>
            Before it can be switched on, the screen states:{" "}
            <em>&quot;Only switch this on if [contact] agreed you could text them. They can reply STOP at
            any time, which stops texts from SwiftCard for good.&quot;</em>{" "}
            Switching it on is the user confirming they have that person&apos;s permission.
          </LI>
          <LI>
            Only that confirmation allows a text. It is recorded server-side as an{" "}
            <strong>sms-ok</strong> flag that can only be set from the user&apos;s own signed-in account —
            no public page, and nothing a visitor&apos;s browser sends, can set it.
          </LI>
          <LI>
            Contacts without that flag — everyone captured by the share form, the business-card scanner,
            manual entry or an import — are <strong>never</strong> sent an automated text. The user can
            still reply by email.
          </LI>
          <LI>
            The user can switch text follow-ups off for any contact at any time, and the contact&apos;s own
            STOP always overrides everything.
          </LI>
        </ul>

        <H2>What the messages are</H2>
        <P>
          Texts are one-to-one follow-ups about the conversation the two people already had: the
          user&apos;s contact details, their replies, and any follow-up messages that user set up for that
          contact. Message frequency varies. Msg &amp; data rates may apply. Reply STOP to opt out, HELP
          for help. There is no marketing, no promotional blasting and no third-party content, and
          mobile numbers or consent are never sold or shared for anyone else&apos;s marketing.
        </P>

        <H2>See it for yourself</H2>
        <P>
          The share form — which collects contact details and nothing else — is on a public page, with no
          login and no demo environment:
        </P>

        <div className="rounded-2xl border border-slate-200/80 bg-[#F5F7FB] p-5 sm:p-6 my-6">

            Scroll to <strong>&quot;Share your info&quot;</strong>. It asks for a name, phone and email so
            those details reach the card&apos;s owner — it does not sign anyone up for text messages, and
            nothing submitted there can start one.
          </p>
        </div>

        <H2>The number messages come from</H2>
        <P>
          Every SwiftCard text — replies, card links, and follow-ups alike — is sent from one shared
          number: <strong>(917) 905-7335</strong>. The SwiftCard user who is writing to you is named in the
          message itself.
        </P>

        <H2>Opting out</H2>
        <P>
          Replying <strong>STOP</strong> to any SwiftCard text suppresses that number across the entire
          platform — no SwiftCard user can text it through SwiftCard afterwards. Replying{" "}
          <strong>HELP</strong> returns program information and support contact details. Questions:{" "}
