 * which is what makes the account chooser read "to continue to swiftcard.me"
 * instead of the raw *.supabase.co project host. See src/lib/native-google-login.ts.
 *
 * `hs` is the SHA-256 of the handoff secret the webview just generated and kept;
 * it is signed into the state so the return leg can seal the ID token to exactly
 * that webview. Nothing here is authenticated — it only builds a Google URL —
 * but a malformed `hs` is refused so junk can never ride the state.
