// ── Product-event ingest ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Receives the funnel events lib/events.ts fires (card started, plan picked,
// upgrade clicked, …) and stores them in OUR database, where /admin/analytics
// reads them. See supabase/product-events.sql for why this is first-party.
//
// Three rules, in order:
//   1. It can never break a user action. Always answers 202 and swallows
//      everything — a failed insert must not surface anywhere.
//   2. It stores no PII. The property allow-list below is the whole contract:
//      unknown keys are dropped, not passed through, so a future call site
//      cannot leak a name or an email into the analytics table by accident.
//   3. It is a PUBLIC endpoint, so it validates hard: an unknown event name is
//      dropped, every string is capped, and one IP is capped per window.

// Constant-time-enough membership check against the closed vocabulary.

    //    only reason it isn't a permanent quiet distortion of every number on
    //    the admin page.
    //  - the request carries an admin (or demo-account) session, or
    //  - the browser was told it was internal on an earlier event and has
