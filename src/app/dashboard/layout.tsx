// Why a layout exists for /dashboard at all: it hosts the iOS shell's launch
// animation. A cold launch loads "/" and src/proxy.ts redirects the shell here
// (or to /login) before any HTML is sent, so THIS is the first page a launch
// paints — the splash markup must be in its initial HTML to hand off from the
// static iOS launch image without a jump. It used to sit in the root layout,
// but its headers()/cookies() reads forced every marketing page dynamic; see
// the note in src/app/layout.tsx. NativeSplash renders nothing on the website
// and nothing on in-app navigations (Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin), and the
// layout renders in the first flush — before the page's data fetches — so the
// first-frame guarantee is preserved.
