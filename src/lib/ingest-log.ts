// ── Why a request was, or was not, counted ───────────────────────────────────
//
// THE GAP THIS FILLS. The pipeline makes a chain of honest decisions — bot,
// prefetch, the owner's own visit, a same-visit reload, a card that no longer
// serves, a rate limit — and then throws away every request it declines. So
// "why is that view missing?" and "is that view real?" were both unanswerable,
// and the only way to judge the classifier was to argue about it. On
// 2026-09-09 the evidence for every finding in the analytics audit had to be
// reconstructed by hand from the surviving rows.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not a second analytics pipeline and no customer-facing
// number may ever be computed from it. card_views remains the one source of
// counted truth; this records the DECISION, not the traffic. The 14-day
// retention in supabase/analytics-accuracy.sql is part of that: a log that
// cannot be summed over a quarter cannot quietly become a shadow warehouse.
//
// WHAT IT MUST NEVER CARRY. No raw IP, no User-Agent, no name, email or phone —
// a decision log about people is still about people. The visitor is identified
// the same pseudonymous way card_views identifies them (the browser id), the bot
// signal is a family NAME rather than the UA that matched it, and the location
// is only ever the confidence level, never the place.
//
// Shaped after push_log and error_events, the two precedents in this project
// for a small, self-trimming, service-role-only decision log.
