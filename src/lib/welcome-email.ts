// ── Welcome email ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This logic lived only inside POST /api/welcome, and nothing ever called that
// route — not the app, not a cron, not a server action. (The /welcome PAGE is
// a different thing entirely.) So no signup has ever received a welcome email,
// and the template, the idempotency claim and its unique index were all dead
// code that looked alive.
//
// Extracted here so the app can call it directly instead of self-fetching its
// own HTTP route from a server component. The route still exists and now
// delegates to this, so any future caller behaves identically.
//
// WHEN IT SENDS: the first time the account HAS A CARD — never at signup
// (owner, 2026-09-11). The subject is "Your SwiftCard is live" and the body
// links to the card, so sending it the moment an account existed promised a
// card that did not, and linked to a URL that 404'd until the builder was
// finished. Signup and a finished card are minutes apart at best, and for
// anyone who abandons the builder they never happen at all.
//
// sendWelcomeWhenCardLive() below is the only thing the app calls. It is safe
// to call from every path that can create a card: it refuses when the account
// has none, and the email_logs claim inside sendWelcomeEmail makes it once per
// account however many times it is reached.

 *
 *   • no card yet            → "skipped"
 *   • card but no plan yet   → "skipped"

 *
 * ── WHY THE PLAN GATE (2026-09-15) ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The card row is created the moment a guest's draft is claimed, which is now
 * BEFORE they have chosen a plan. Sending on card creation therefore mailed
 * "Your SwiftCard is live" to someone still sitting on the plan screen, and —
 * worse — before a Pro buyer had paid. The owner's rule is that the mail goes
 * out once the plan is settled: after payment for a paid plan, or on confirming
 * Free. Since 2026-09-16 that is also the moment a new account's card goes
 * live (lib/card-active rule 5), so the email and the card agree.
 *
 * The account email is resolved from AUTH, not from profiles.email — that
 * column drifts to the card's public contact address the moment someone sets
 * one (see lib/account-email.ts), and owner mail must never follow it.
