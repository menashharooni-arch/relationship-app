// ── Central "is this card allowed to be public?" kill-switch ────────────────
// EVERY public surface (card page, Swift Links, OG/share image, Apple Wallet
// pass, lead capture, vCard) must consult this so there is no bypass:
//
//   1. DELETED account  → every card, link, QR, signature link, and wallet
//      pass of that account is inactive.
//   2. DELETED card     → the row is gone; nothing resolves (handled by the
//      lookups themselves).
//   3. DOWNGRADED plan  → a Free account only serves FREE_CARD_LIMIT card(s):
//      the one it chose when Pro ended, else the oldest (pickFreeLiveCardIds).
//      Extra cards created on Pro go
//      inactive the moment the plan is no longer paid — links, QRs, NFC
//      tags, wallet passes and lead capture for them all stop working.
//      Their remaining Free-plan card's links keep working.
//   4. TAKEN OFFLINE    → an office admin pulled the card from /office/admin.
//      Everything the card serves goes dark, but nothing is deleted, so it can
//      be brought back online. Used when an employee leaves.
//   5. NO PLAN CHOSEN   → a NEW account's card is not live until its owner has
//      chosen a plan (owner, 2026-09-16: create the account → the card isn't
//      live yet → choose Pro, Office or Free → then it goes live). The owner
//      can still see it; nobody else can.
