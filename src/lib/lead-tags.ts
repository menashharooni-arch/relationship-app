// Reserved lead tags are SERVER-OWNED — they drive org visibility, the Free
// paywall, and automation state, so a client must never set or clear them by
// PATCHing a lead's `tags` array. Without this, a user could:
//   • inject `sc-office-<otherOrgId>` to plant a lead in another company's
//     Leads tab (cross-org pollution), or
//   • strip `sc-locked` from their own capped Free lead to unlock it for free,
//     or pause/unpause automation (`flow-paused`, `email-paused`, `sms-paused`,
//     `sms-ok`, `preset-*`) they aren't meant to touch directly.
// `sms-ok` is the affirmative SMS-consent marker (TCPA opt-in): the cron sends
// an automated text ONLY when it's present. It is server-owned so a client
// can't forge consent by PATCHing it, and so it survives unrelated tag edits.

// non-reserved tags from the client are honored. Order: kept reserved tags
// first, then the client's own tags (de-duplicated).
