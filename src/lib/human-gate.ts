// ── Is there actually a person in front of this page? ────────────────────────
//
// The server's bot check is a User-Agent denylist (lib/bot-detection.ts), and a
// denylist only catches what it has heard of. The families that matter most —
// link-preview renderers and crawler render farms — present a completely normal
// browser UA, so they sail past it. Three things they cannot fake are available
// in the browser, and this is them:
//
//   1. navigator.webdriver — every automation framework sets it (Playwright,
//      Puppeteer, Selenium, and the crawler renderers built on top of them).
//   2. The page must actually be VISIBLE. Preview renderers paint into a hidden
//      surface and never bring it forward.
//   3. A dwell, still visible at the end of it. A preview crawler snapshots and
//      destroys the page in well under two seconds; a person who just opened a
//      card is still looking at it.
//
// A real visitor who bounces inside the dwell loses the event. That is the
// deliberate trade, made on the owner's order of 2026-08-26: views "cannot have
// misinformation", and an owner must never be told someone opened their card
// when no one did.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The gate lived inline in CardEventTracker, so the card
// view was gated and nothing else was. ScanSaveContact fires a "downloaded your
// contact card" event straight from an effect on page load — no webdriver check,
// no visibility check, no dwell — which means anything that merely LOADED a
// ?save=1 URL with a browser-shaped UA booked a contact download on the owner's
// card and a notification on their phone. One implementation, used by both, is
// the only way the two surfaces cannot drift apart again.
