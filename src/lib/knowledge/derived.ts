// ── Facts the assistants derive from code, never from prose ─────────────────
//
// Everything in this file is COMPUTED from the modules that already are the
// single source of truth (plan.ts, plan-content.ts, template-style-presets.ts,
// crm-connection.ts). Change a price, a limit, a plan feature line, a template,
// or a CRM provider and every assistant surface says the new thing on the next
// request — no prompt to remember to edit.
//
// The rule for this file: if a fact lives in a data structure anywhere in the
// codebase, derive it here. Only facts that exist solely as behaviour (how a
// flow works, what a button does) belong in the hand-written docs/.
