// ── Product knowledge base: types ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ONE corpus of product truth, consumed by every assistant surface:
//   • /api/ai/sales   — public marketing chat  (audience: "visitor")
//   • /api/ai/help    — in-app assistant       (audience: "user")
//   • /api/ai/help?area=office-admin           (audience: "office-admin")
//
// Before this existed, each route carried its own hand-written prose describing
// the product, so shipping a feature meant remembering to edit two prompts and
// two trigger lists — which never happened. A doc written once here reaches
// every surface, and tests/knowledge-truth.test.ts fails the build when a doc
// drifts from the code it describes.
