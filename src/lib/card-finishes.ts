// ── Card finishes: the material laid over the panel colour ──────────────────
//
// A card's branding panel could be a colour or a two-stop gradient, and that
// was the whole vocabulary. A FINISH is a material composed OVER whatever
// colour the owner already picked, so it multiplies with the six templates and
// every colour instead of being another list of presets to scroll.
//
// PAINTED, NEVER BLURRED. Swift Links does its glass with `backdrop-filter`,
// which is correct there — a Swift Links page only ever exists in a browser.
// A CARD DOES NOT. The same markup is also:
//
//   • rasterised to PNG for the download and share image  (html-to-image)
//   • drawn into link-preview images                      (next/og · satori)
//   • pasted into email signatures                        (mail clients)
//
// `backdrop-filter` renders in none of those. Port the Swift Links glass across
// and you ship a card that looks right on screen and wrong in every exported
// form. So "Frosted" below is a painted sheet — layered gradients that composite
// to the same look and survive every one of those renderers.
//
// WHY THIS REACHES ALL SIX TEMPLATES WITH NO TEMPLATE CHANGES: each of them
// resolves its panel as `style.bgColor ?? <its own default>` and hands that to
// one `background:`. Composing here, inside templateStyle(), means ClassicPro,
// ModernBold, PhotoFirst, LocalBusiness, LuxuryMinimal and LogoFirst — and every
// one of the seventeen places that render a template — pick it up for free.
