// ── Writing one key of profiles.customization without losing it ──────────────
//
// `customization` is a single JSONB column that several unrelated features
// share: the push switches and quiet-hours timezone (_push), the monthly free
// meters (_usage), the AI consent flag, the one-time migration marks. PostgREST
// has no partial JSONB update, so every writer does read-modify-write on the
// WHOLE object — and a writer holding a stale snapshot silently deletes
// whatever landed after it read.
//
// Measured, not theoretical (2026-09-11): on the first dashboard load of a new
// account the server runs two one-time migrations that each rewrite the column
// from the page's snapshot, while the browser reports its timezone. The PATCH
// returned 200, the client recorded "already reported", and _push was gone.
//
// The same race can erase `_usage`, and that one has a price: the free monthly
// contact meter resetting to zero is a month of free contacts, and the whole
// point of keeping the count on the ACCOUNT is that it cannot be reset by
// anything the owner does.
//
// So every write to a customization key goes through here, and here READS BACK
// what it wrote. A lost write is retried against the fresh object instead of
// being reported as a success.

/**
 * JSON with object keys SORTED, so two equal values compare equal.
 *
 * The read-back compared JSON.stringify of what was written with what came
 * back — but a jsonb column does not keep key order (it stores shorter keys
 * first), so {"period","leads","drafts"} came back as {"leads","drafts",
 * "period"} and EVERY write of an object looked lost. It was retried, and for
 * the monthly counter each retry added one more: every contact a Free account
 * captured counted three times — 12/5 after four contacts, locking them from
 * the third (2026-09-23 notification review, reproduced on production).
