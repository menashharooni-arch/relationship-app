// This module holds the service-role key, which bypasses every row-level
// security policy in the database — the most dangerous value in the product.
// "Only use server-side" was a comment, and a comment is a hope.
//
// WHAT ENFORCES IT: tests/server-only-boundary.test.ts, which walks the import
// graph out of every "use client" entry and fails CI with the offending chain
// if any of them can reach this file. Verified to fire by injecting a
// violation and watching it fail, then pass again once removed.
//
// WHAT DOES NOT: `import "server-only"`, the React-official marker, was tried
// here first and does nothing under Turbopack — a client component that
// imports AND CALLS getAdminSupabase built with exit code 0 and loaded in a
// real browser with no build error and no console error. It also broke the
// test runner, which resolves the package to its throwing path. A guard that
// looks like protection and isn't is worse than none, so it is gone.
//
// Nothing has ever leaked: Next does not inline a non-NEXT_PUBLIC_ env var
// into client code, so the key itself cannot travel even along a bad import.
// The two modules that had drifted onto a client path (office-leads,
// office-team, each via a display constant) now keep those constants in
// lib/lead-status and lib/member-status.
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

// Service-role client — bypasses RLS. Server-side only; see above.
