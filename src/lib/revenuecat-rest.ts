 * Does RevenueCat say this account holds an active Pro entitlement right now?

 *   null  — can't tell (no REVENUECAT_SECRET_KEY, RevenueCat down, bad reply)
 *
 * Asked by the webhook where an event alone doesn't settle it: the account a
 * subscription was TRANSFERRED away from (only take Pro off if it really has
 * none left), and a refund (RevenueCat reports it as a CANCELLATION, which is
 * normally "auto-renew switched off, access continues"). Callers decide what
 * `null` means for them; nothing here writes.
