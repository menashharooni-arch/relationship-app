// ── Who is on the other end of a view, decided by the SERVER ─────────────────
//
// THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR. One visit to a freshly-created card produced FOUR
// counted views and FOUR "unique visitors" (prod, 2026-09-14 15:55–15:56 on
// menashharooni-swiftcard-2: four card_views rows, four different visitor ids,
// one card, ninety seconds). request-geo.ts had already written down the same
// shape from an earlier sighting — "seven views, seven different visitor ids, a
// fresh browser each time".
//
// The cause was never the dedupe logic; it was the KEY the dedupe logic ran on.
// The visitor id was minted by page script into localStorage (lib/visitor.ts)
// and sent up in the request body, so it is only as durable as that browser's
// storage. In-app browsers (LinkedIn, Instagram, Messages), a WKWebView that
// gets a fresh data store per open, Safari's storage partitioning and private
// windows, an ITP eviction, a cleared site — every one of them hands the next
// page load a BRAND NEW id. And a brand new id defeats both halves of the old
// dedupe at once:
//
//   • the visit-window lookup is keyed on visitor_id, so it matches nothing;
//   • the per-IP backstop sat in an `else` branch, reached ONLY when no
//     visitor id was supplied at all — so a fresh-id-every-load client
//     skipped it every single time.
//
// One visit, N loads, N rows, N "unique visitors". Exactly what the owner saw.
//
// TWO DURABLE SIGNALS REPLACE THE ONE FRAGILE ONE.
//
//   1. sc_vid — a first-party, httpOnly cookie the ingest routes set on the
//      response. A cookie survives everything localStorage survives and a good
//      deal that it doesn't, page script can neither read nor rotate it, and
//      it is scoped to this site alone. On first sight we ADOPT the client's
//      existing localStorage id rather than minting over it, so every visitor
//      already known to the dashboard keeps their history and their "repeat
//      visitor" status.
//
//   2. deviceKey — sha256(ip + user-agent + card), computed on every request
//      and stored on the row. Never an identity and never displayed: it is the
//      answer to "has THIS BROWSER ON THIS NETWORK already been counted for
//      THIS CARD in this visit?", which is the question a client with no
//      durable storage at all cannot answer for us. Hashed because the raw IP
//      is deliberately not persisted (see record-view.ts), and salted with the
//      card key so the stored value cannot be used to follow one device from
//      one owner's card to another's.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not collapse visitors by IP.
// Two people behind one office NAT are two people (self-traffic.ts spells out
// why that rule matters), and they reach here with two different user agents,
// two different cookies, or both. The only pair this merges is a pair that
// shares an IP AND a byte-identical User-Agent AND lands inside the same
// 30-minute window — which is one person's page re-loading, not a conference
// room.
