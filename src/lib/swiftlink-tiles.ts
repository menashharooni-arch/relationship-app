// ── Swift Links tile layout ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// hoo.be's pages breathe because tiles VARY — a full-width feature, pairs of
// half-width cards, slim rows for plain links. Ours rendered one shape. Each
// link can now carry a size, with an automatic default, and this module is the
// single place the layout decision lives (pure, so it's testable without
// rendering anything).
//
//   featured — full-width 1.91:1 image tile (the hero treatment)
//   grid     — half-width tile, packs in pairs (the classic album grid)
//   compact  — slim full-width row: icon circle + label + chevron. For plain
//              links that don't deserve a big image tile.
//
// AUTO (no explicit size): video → featured is wrong as a blanket rule (three
// videos would each eat a full row), so auto = grid, and the odd-grid-out is
// PROMOTED to featured — which reproduces the pre-sizes layout exactly for
// all-auto pages: odd count → first tile big, rest in pairs.
//
// PLAN LINE (the agreed Free floor): Free pages render every link COMPACT —
// featured tiles, the grid, and inline video are the "premium Swift Links"
// that plan-content has always advertised as Pro. Sizes a Free account has
// stored are kept, not deleted; they simply don't render until the plan does.
