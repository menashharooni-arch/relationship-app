// A card owner poking at their own card/SwiftLink/preview must NEVER count as a
// visitor. Every public ingest endpoint (views, card-events, analytics/event)
// runs the SAME server-side check so there is no bypass. Client suppression
// (localStorage / a `self` flag / a client-supplied user or card id) is a UX
// nicety only — it is NEVER trusted for the exclusion decision.
//
// CRITICAL: exclusion is IDENTITY/OWNERSHIP-based, not IP-based. A legitimate
// external visitor who happens to share the owner's IP (office NAT, shared
// device while signed out, phone on the same Wi-Fi) MUST still count. Only the
// authenticated session that OWNS the exact slug is excluded — a team member or
// office admin viewing a colleague's card is a real visitor and is counted.

// A SwiftLink surface is tracked under "<slug>__links"; strip that suffix so the
// owner lookup resolves back to the underlying card. Plain card slugs are
// unaffected (they never contain "__links").

// ── The SECOND owner signal, and why one was not enough ──────────────────────
//
// For months the only way this file could recognise an owner was an
// authenticated Supabase session on the request. Production says that signal
// never once fired: across the entire history of analytics_ingest_log there
// are ZERO decisions with reason "self", while the owner's own views of his own
// cards were recorded as anonymous visitors and pushed to his own phone.
//
// The reason is structural. A card page and a Swift Links page are PUBLIC
// routes, and public routes are deliberately outside src/proxy.ts's matcher —
// so nothing on those requests refreshes the session or persists a rotated
// refresh token (the matcher's own comment spells out that hazard). An owner
// arriving at their card with an expired access token therefore reads as
// signed-out to getUser(), and with only one signal there was nothing else to
// ask. Add to that the ordinary cases — the card opened from the share sheet,
// from a QR scan, from an in-app browser, from the phone rather than the laptop
// they are signed in on — and "the owner is a visitor" is the common path, not
// the edge.
//
// sc_device is the answer, and it costs nothing new: src/proxy.ts already
// plants it on every authenticated route, it is httpOnly (page script can
// neither read nor forge it), it is a year long, and user_devices maps it to
// the account that claimed it. It says "this browser profile is signed in as
// <user>", which is a narrower and more honest claim than an IP will ever be —
// it is one browser on one machine, exactly the thing an owner uses to look at
// their own card.
//
// STILL NOT IP-BASED, and still per-identity: a visitor who shares the owner's
// network, or borrows their phone while signed out of a DIFFERENT browser, has
// no sc_device of the owner's and counts normally.

    // opened his own /swiftcard while the other account's row happened to be
    // fresher, this check named the wrong account, and his own visit was
    // recorded as a stranger and pushed to his own phone.
