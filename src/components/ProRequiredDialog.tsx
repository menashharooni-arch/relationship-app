/**
 * Save Changes, blocked because the card is using Pro design.
 *
 * The old behaviour was silent: a Free account could pick Brushed, drop in a
 * background video, press Save Changes, get a success message — and then find
 * a flat card on the live link, because the server sanitized the Pro keys away
 * on the way in. Nothing lied exactly, but the person was never told, and the
 * one moment they most wanted the feature was spent teaching them the product
 * does not do what they just watched it do.
 *
 * So the preview stays open — every Pro finish and the photo/video picker are
 * still tappable on Free, the card still renders them in the editor, that is
 * the demo — and the wall moves to Save. This is what stands at the wall.
 *
 * THE TRIAL IS THE OFFER (owner, 2026-09-11)
 * A 14-day free trial first, and the monthly price second. The offer box and
 * the button both come from components/ProOffer, which is also what the Add
 * card sheet renders — so the wording, the price and the destination are one
 * implementation and cannot drift between the two sheets or between platforms.
 *
 * `trialEligible` is resolved on the SERVER by the page that renders the
 * editor, using lib/trial-eligibility — the identical helper the checkout API
 * enforces with. Someone who has ever had a subscription is not offered a
 * second trial here, and their button carries `trial=0` so the checkout page's
 * copy matches. The promise on the button and the session it creates cannot
 * drift, which is the whole reason that helper is shared rather than re-guessed.
 *
 * THE SAME SHEET ON BOTH PLATFORMS
 * This dialog used to render one thing on the web and something else entirely
 * in the shell — a different component, different words, a different shape —
 * which is exactly what the owner reported. It does not any more: the badge,
 * the headline, the sentence, the list, the offer box and the button are one
 * set of markup. Only two things differ, and both are forced (see
 * components/ProOffer): the price comes from StoreKit on iOS because Apple
 * charges it in the viewer's own currency and must match what is shown
 * (3.1.2), and the button goes to in-app purchase rather than a website
 * (3.1.3(b)). Neither is visible as a difference in layout or wording.
