/**
 * The moment someone picks Free after building with Pro design.
 *
 * It used to work like this: they chose Free, their card was rewritten, and
 * THEN a grey sentence appeared saying "Custom colors and premium design
 * options are available on Pro" with a single Continue button. The decision
 * was already made, the card was already changed, the sentence described the
 * plan rather than their card, and there was no way back.
 *
 * That is the highest-intent moment in the entire product and it was being
 * spent on a disclaimer. Someone who has just spent ten minutes on a card
 * feels it is theirs — so the honest and the persuasive thing are the same
 * thing here: tell them exactly what is about to change, before it changes,
 * and offer the one option that keeps it.
 *
 * Three rules this component follows:
 *
 *  1. It only appears when the card ACTUALLY changes. `changes` comes from the
 *     converter, so tapping a Free Look never triggers this.
 *  2. Free is a real exit, not a dark pattern. The secondary button is plainly
 *     labelled, says what is kept, and is one tap.
 *  3. NATIVE (the iOS shell) offers the SAME choice through Apple: the trial
 *     button is the In-App Purchase sheet (IapSubscribeButton — StoreKit price,
 *     Restore, renewal terms), never Stripe, and its fine print names Apple.
 *     (It used to hide the offer entirely, from before in-app purchase existed;
 *     owner, 2026-09-16: "the same exact way that it does on the web app".)
