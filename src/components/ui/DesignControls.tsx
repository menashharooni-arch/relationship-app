// ── The Design editor's control vocabulary ───────────────────────────────────
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Every design surface in the app grew its own controls
// in place, so the Design tab ended up speaking five dialects at once. Measured
// at 390px on 2026-09-15, one panel (TemplateStyleControls) held 66 interactive
// controls in SEVEN different font sizes, and "selected" was drawn five
// different ways depending on which section you were in:
//
//   templates grid   solid blue fill, white text
//   logo shape       grey fill on a grey track   ← barely visible at all
//   font pills       blue border + 10% blue tint
//   finish swatches  blue border + 10% blue tint
//   "Default" chip   blue border, blue text, no fill
//   ground swatches  a 2px blue box-shadow ring
//
// None of that was a decision; it is what happens when six sections are written
// on six different days. One vocabulary, defined once, is the only thing that
// stops it happening a seventh time.
//
// THE RULES THIS ENCODES
//
//   • A Switch is for a setting that is ON or OFF and nothing else. If there
//     are three states or three options, it is a Segmented, not a switch with
//     a friend.
//   • Segmented is for 2-4 mutually exclusive choices that fit on one row.
//     Beyond that a grid of cards reads better than a squeezed segment.
//   • Selected has exactly TWO forms, and which one depends on what the
//     control's face is showing:
//       - a control whose face is a LABEL (font pill, segment, template,
//         "Default") is FILLED blue with white text;
//       - a control whose face IS THE PREVIEW (colour swatch, Look tile,
//         finish tile) takes a blue RING with a gap, because filling it would
//         paint over the very thing being chosen.
//     Two forms, one meaning. What is banned is the third, fourth and fifth
//     form the panel had grown: a 10% tint, a bare outline, a grey-on-grey.
//   • Three type sizes. Section 11px, label 13px, help 11px. That is the whole
//     scale; anything else is a new dialect.
//   • 44px minimum tap target on touch devices (.sc-tap / .sc-tap-sq in
//     globals.css, applied on any-pointer: coarse so desktop keeps its
//     density).
//
// Everything here is presentational and controlled — the caller owns the value.

/**
 * Section 11px · label 13px · help 11px. The entire type scale.
 *
 * Written in REM, not px, and that is not cosmetic: the root font-size is
 * driven by --sc-text-scale, which the native shell sets from iOS Dynamic Type
 * (MainViewController). A px-pinned size renders identically at the 16px default
 * and then refuses to grow when someone turns Larger Text on — pinned by
 * tests/accessibility-invariants.test.ts, which caught exactly that in the
 * first draft of this file.
