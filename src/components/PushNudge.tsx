// The ask to turn notifications on, at the top of the dashboard.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT NATIVE-ONLY ANY MORE. This started life as NativePushNudge,
// shown only inside the iPhone shell, on the reasoning that a new account
// already meets the push switch on the "Your card is live!" screen. That
// reasoning quietly excluded almost everybody: most people sign up on a laptop,
// see the switch once in the middle of building their first card — before they
// have any idea what a notification from SwiftCard would even say — and are
// never asked again. The push table shows the result plainly: two registered
// devices in the entire product. A notification system nobody receives is worth
// exactly nothing, so the ask now runs wherever it can actually succeed.
//
// AT MOST TWO ASKS, EVER. The first is on sight. The second only happens once
// the person's card has real views — the one moment the offer stops being an
// abstraction and starts being "there is something to tell you about". After
// that the banner is gone for good and Settings is the only way in. That
// ceiling is the point: a prompt that keeps coming back is the same disrespect
// as a notification that keeps coming back.
