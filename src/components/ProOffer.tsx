// LAZY, AND CLIENT-ONLY ON PURPOSE.
//
// A plain `import IapSubscribeButton from "@/components/NativePaywall"` here
// broke a page this component does not even appear on: /welcome started
// throwing a hydration mismatch in production builds (React #418), and only in
// production — dev was clean, which is exactly how a bundling problem hides.
//
// The cause is the module graph, not the markup. Pulling NativePaywall in
// statically drags it (and lib/iap) into a chunk shared with other pages, where
// its module-level StoreKit-status cache is then evaluated at a different
// moment relative to hydration than it was before — so the server HTML and the
// first client render stop agreeing on a page that has its own paywall button.
//
// `ssr: false` keeps it out of the server render and out of everyone else's
// chunk. Nothing is lost: this button only ever renders inside the iOS shell,
// which is a client-only context by definition.
const IapSubscribeButton = dynamic(() => import("@/components/NativePaywall"), { ssr: false });

// ── One Pro offer, rendered the same everywhere ──────────────────────────────
//
// The owner's report, and it was right: the popup on the phone was not the
// popup on the computer. The web version showed a headline, a feature list, a
// price and a button; the shell showed a different component entirely (the
// shared PlanNotice) with different words and a different shape. Two surfaces
// selling the same thing, looking nothing like each other.
//
// So the offer lives in ONE place now. Both dialogs — the one behind Save
// Changes and the one behind Add card — render these two pieces, so the sheet a
// person sees on a phone is the sheet they saw on their laptop: same box, same
// headline, same sentence, same button in the same position.
//
// THE ONE THING THAT CANNOT BE IDENTICAL, AND WHY
//
// The dollar amount. On the web the price is ours: Stripe charges USD and
// PLAN_PRICES is the truth. Inside the iOS app the price is APPLE'S — it varies
// by storefront (a reader in Berlin is charged in euro, in London in pounds),
// and App Store rule 3.1.2 requires the price shown to be the price charged.
// Hardcoding "$4.99" in the shell would be both wrong for most of the world and
// a review risk, so on native the number comes from StoreKit and nowhere else.
// If StoreKit has not answered yet, the line renders without a figure rather
// than inventing one.
//
// Same reason the button differs under the hood: on iOS a subscription the app
// unlocks has to be bought through in-app purchase (3.1.3(b)), never by sending
// someone to a website. It looks and reads the same; it just goes to StoreKit.
