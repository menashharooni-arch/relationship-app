// The card page's "Swift Links" box, as the marketing mockups show it.
//
// This exists because the box lives inside THREE phone mockups (TemplateGallery
// on the homepage and /products/digital-cards, LeadCapturePhone, SignatureDemo)
// and every one of them had its own hand-copied version. They drifted: the card
// page moved to the ghost chip, the website capsule, the brand discs and the
// action-link table, and all three mockups were still showing the retired
// full-width "bars" list with a "Go to Swift Links →" footnote. One component,
// used by all three, is what stops that happening again.
//
// The structure below mirrors src/app/[username]/page.tsx's Swift Links
// section exactly — plain bold heading + chip (the numbered badges are gone
// from the real page, owner redesign 2026-08-19), bio, rule, socials rail,
// rule, action links — and the pieces that ARE the design
// (SocialLinkIntercept's "rail", CardActionLinks) are the live components,
// not copies, so a change there lands here for free.

// The same connect links the live card builds (website + socials). "rail"
// splits them itself: the website becomes a capsule, the socials become discs.

});

// Bio and links match the live demo card (/demo-realty) so the marketing
// mockup and the card people actually open tell the same story. Both URLs are
// already reached by CONNECT_LINKS, so nothing new is fetched for the favicons.
const BIO = "Bay Area homes, from first tour to closing day. Let's find yours.";
// Labels are kept to ~16 characters on purpose. CardActionLinks truncates its
// row label, and the narrow phone frame leaves it about 128px — "Connect on
// LinkedIn" came back as "Connect on Link…", which reads as a bug in a mockup
// even though it is the real component behaving correctly.

 * compact={false} and matches the live page.

            styling is dropped for the same reason.

            The compact frame abbreviates the label. Measured, not guessed: that
            header row is 213px wide inside the phone, and the full
            "View Swift Link page →" leaves the heading 44px — it wrapped
            "Swift Links" onto two lines. The alternative was shrinking the
            heading, but it would then be smaller than "Save Alex's contact" and
            "Share this card" in the same phone, which reads as a bug. The
            chip's position, weight and colour are what carry the design here;
            SignatureDemo renders at true scale and keeps the full wording. */}
