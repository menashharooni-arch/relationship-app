// Owner request 2026-08-19, modeled on link.me's hero: a white pill holding
// the brand mark, an inline first-name input, and an attached "Start for
// free" button. Enter or the button routes into the card builder with the
// typed name pre-filled (?name=…), so the visitor's first act of typing is
// already the first field of their card — the CTA IS the product.
//
// Empty submits still go to the builder: an empty box must never be a wall
// between a willing visitor and the wizard.
