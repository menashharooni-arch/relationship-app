/**
 * Mounts the AI-consent ask GLOBALLY (root layout), so it appears on the first
 * signed-in native screen INSIDE THE APP — whichever screen that is.
 *
 * Not during Get Started (owner, 2026-09-18). "The first signed-in screen" used
 * to be the dashboard; once the app's Create Account became build a card →
 * create the account → choose a plan, it became the plan step, and the dialog
 * landed in the middle of onboarding. It now waits for both halves of the rule
 * in lib/ai-consent: the screen is not a setup step (aiConsentAskAllowedOn) and
 * the account has a live card with its plan chosen (`ready`). Until then the
 * server keeps blocking AI requests from the app, so nothing is sent unasked.
 *
 * Why global: the gate used to be mounted per-page, on /dashboard and
 * /contacts only, while AI features are reachable from far more places (the
 * help bubble is on every app page, the design scanner lives on /cards/new and
 * the editor). Any path that reached one of those before crossing a page with
 * the gate shared data with the provider having asked nothing — which is the
 * exact sentence in the 5.1.1(i)/5.1.2(i) rejection, three rounds running.
 * Server-side, aiConsentPermits now blocks those requests anyway (unset blocks
 * in the app); this mount is what asks the question, so features work instead
 * of 403ing.
 *
 * Web cost: none. The component renders nothing and fetches nothing unless the
 * shell bridge is present, so the website gains no UI and no traffic.
 *
 * The pathname effect re-checks after a 401: the layout persists across the
 * login transition, so a fetch made on /login (signed out) must be retried
 * once the user is in — otherwise the ask would wait for the next cold launch.
