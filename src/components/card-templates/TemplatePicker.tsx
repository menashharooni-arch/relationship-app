// The template gallery at the top of the Card design tab — shared by the edit
// form and the new-card wizard, which had each grown their own copy.
//
// It replaced six text buttons ("Classic Pro", "Modern Bold"…). Choosing a
// template is the biggest decision on the tab, and a name told you nothing
// about it: people tapped through all six while watching a preview that was
// often scrolled off-screen. Every tile is now the REAL template, drawn with the
// owner's own details and their current colours — so what a tile shows is
// exactly what tapping it produces (style carries across a template switch, as
// it always has; the "Original" Look undoes that in one tap).
//
// Custom design is a slim row UNDER the six rather than a banner above them:
// an advanced Pro path, one option among seven.
//
// THE ROW IS ON EVERY CARD-DESIGN SCREEN, and it is only ever OPEN to a paying
// account (owner, 2026-09-18: "I want custom design to be shown with a very
// small pro tag but I want it to be locked. The only time someone can ever
// access custom design is in the actual dashboard if they pay for the Pro or
// Office plan."). So there is no longer a way to leave it out: Get Started, the
// homepage builders, Add card, Edit card and Office Branding all draw the same
// seven options. Locked, it carries the small PRO tag, reads "Locked" and does
// nothing when tapped; the caller decides only whether it is open.
//
// Tile markup: the thumbnail is an inert picture and the BUTTON is a sibling
// laid over it, never its ancestor. A template renders real <a> links, and an
// <a> inside a <button> is invalid HTML (and a hydration warning), inert or not.
