// ── The QR-scan landing behaviour ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Scanning the desktop "Scan QR code" popup used to send the phone straight to
// the raw .vcf endpoint. The contact sheet appeared, but the moment it was
// dismissed the visitor was staring at a blank page holding a downloaded file —
// the card they'd just scanned was nowhere.
//
// So the QR now lands on the CARD PAGE with ?save=1, and this component fires
// the vCard from there. The phone stacks its native "Add to Contacts" sheet on
// top, and when that's dismissed the full SwiftCard is already loaded
// underneath, ready to scroll.
//
// Delivery is a hidden IFRAME rather than window.location: navigating the top
// frame to a text/vcard URL leaves Android Chrome on a blank tab (it treats the
// navigation as a download and the page it came from is gone). An iframe hands
// the file over while the card page keeps the viewport — same trick the wallet
// pass uses.

    //   • the tab going hidden and returning — when the sheet is its own surface
    //   • the window regaining focus — how iOS behaves on dismissal
    //   • a timer, because iOS can draw the sheet over Safari WITHOUT ever
    //     marking the page hidden or blurring it, and a signal-only approach

    // ── Record the download, but only for a PERSON ───────────────────────────
    //
    // This used to fire the moment the effect ran. No webdriver check, no
    // visibility check, no dwell — so anything that merely LOADED a ?save=1 URL
    // while presenting a browser-shaped User-Agent booked a contact download on
    // the owner's card and a notification on their phone. The card view on this
    // same page has been gated since 2026-08-26; the save never was, which made
    // the two surfaces of one page disagree about what counts as a human.
    //
    // The gate runs CONCURRENTLY with delivery above, not in front of it: the
    // visitor scanned a QR to get a contact, and making them wait 2.5 seconds
    // for the sheet to protect a statistic would be the wrong trade. Delivery
    // is unchanged at 700ms; only the event waits.
    //
    // acceptBackgroundedAfterVisible is why this path needs its own flag: the
    // OS "Add to Contacts" sheet marks the page hidden, so the view gate's
    // "still visible at the end" test would reject the most common successful
    // save there is. A page that was NEVER visible still fails, which is what
    // keeps preview renderers out.
    //

    // recording twice would double the owner's notification and their contact
    // download count off a single scan.
