// ── Push works on EVERY plan, and only for the five things worth interrupting ─
//
// Owner order 2026-09-06: "Make push notifications work for every account type
// and plan (free, paid, trial, office)… then make them high-signal, not spammy."
//
// Two contracts are guarded here and they pull in opposite directions, which is
// exactly why both need tests:
//
//   1. NO PLAN GATE. A Free account's first lead is the most important
//      notification SwiftCard will ever send. The plan is written to the log so
//      it can be audited; nothing branches on it. The per-plan cases below are
//      byte-identical apart from the plan string — that repetition IS the test.
//
//   2. A CLOSED LIST. Only new_lead, lead_reply, contact_saved, card_view,
//      meeting_booked and billing_problem may reach a phone, under a daily cap,
//      inside quiet hours, with copy that fits a lock screen.
