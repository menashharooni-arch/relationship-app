// ── Reset throws away the cadence; it does not flip the switch ───────────────
//
// Reported from the field: turn the Email or Text automation OFF on a contact
// that already has one submitted, press Reset, and the channel comes back ON.
//
// resetChannel stripped the channel's own pause tag unconditionally:
//
//   const tags = (selected.tags ?? []).filter(
//     (t) => t !== "flow-paused" && t !== (ch === "email" ? "email-paused" : "sms-paused"));
//
// and for SMS it passed smsConsent:true, which makes the server grant sms-ok
// AND drop sms-paused (see updateTags). So a reset silently re-armed a channel
// the user had just switched off — the worst direction for this to fail in,
// because the next cron run then messages someone the owner had stopped.
//
// The rule: only SUBMITTING a new automation turns a channel on. submitDraft
// still clears the pause tags, deliberately, and that is left alone.
