// STRUCTURAL GUARD — "the preview lies" bug class.
//
// A live preview is a promise: what you see while editing is what visitors get.
// That promise has now been broken twice, both times the same way — a field was
// added to the thing that RENDERS, and a call site was left passing nothing:
//
//   1. The card preview hardcoded `website: ""` while the save sent
//      `website.trim()`, so the website silently never appeared while building
//      the card and only showed up after it was created. It read as "the
//      website didn't save".
//   2. The Swift Links hero learned to fall back to the card's logo, but the
//      three SwiftLinkLivePreview call sites never passed `logoUrl` — so
//      /links/[username] showed the logo while the wizard, the editor and the
//      homepage mini-builder all still showed initials for the same card.
//
// Neither was caught by tsc: every one of these props is OPTIONAL, which is
// exactly why they can be silently forgotten. Nothing but a test closes that.
//
// So: adding a hero identity field to SwiftLinkProfile and forgetting a call
// site now fails here rather than shipping a preview that disagrees with the
// page it is previewing.
