// ── Guest LinkedIn photo → back into the homepage builder ────────────────────
//
// Owner, 2026-09-22: "whenever I create a card on 'See how your SwiftLink would
// look', LinkedIn profile pictures do not connect properly."
//
// The callback always did its job: it copied the consented photo into our
// storage and sent the visitor back to `returnTo` with ?li_photo=. The hole was
// on the receiving end. The three homepage builders returned to "/" — and only
// /cards/new ever read ?li_photo=. So the visitor landed on the top of the
// homepage, builder closed, and GuestFlowReset (which treats every signed-out
// homepage load as a fresh start) wiped the sketch on top of that.
//
// Now each builder returns to /?builder=<product>: the matching builder
// re-opens on step 1 with its stashed sketch, the photo goes on top, and the
// homepage reset stands aside for that one load.
