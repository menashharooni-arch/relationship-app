// ── A contact that was added is spent, even if it is deleted ─────────────────
//
// Owner, 2026-09-11: "when a contact is added it's recorded and if they delete
// it, that doesn't lower it (because they could just save it to their phone
// then delete it). Anytime, whether they put it in themselves or it comes from
// somewhere else, a contact is put in our app for that card, it counts as one
// even if they delete it."
//
// The meter therefore lives on the ACCOUNT (profiles.customization._usage), not
// on a count of rows, and nothing anywhere decrements it. These pin that, plus
// the two things that quietly break it: a delete path that "tidies up" the
// count, and a stale-snapshot write to the shared customization column that
// erases the meter altogether — which would hand out a whole free month.
