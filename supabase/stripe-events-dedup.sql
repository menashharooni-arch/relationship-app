-- Webhook idempotency: dedup Stripe event redeliveries.
-- Stripe guarantees at-least-once delivery, so the same event id can arrive
-- more than once. The webhook records each processed event id here and skips
-- anything it has already handled, so receipts aren't emailed twice and
-- cascades don't run twice. Old rows are pruned after 30 days.
--
-- Run this in the Supabase SQL editor. Until it exists, the webhook fails OPEN
-- (processes every event) — the handlers are largely idempotent by construction,
-- so this is a safety upgrade, not a prerequisite for correctness.

create table if not exists public.stripe_events (
  event_id   text primary key,

-- Service-role only; never exposed to clients.
alter table public.stripe_events enable row level security;

-- Housekeeping: drop the index name collision guard is unnecessary (PK covers it).
