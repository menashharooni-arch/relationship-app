// ── Keep our own QA traffic out of the product funnel ───────────────────────
//
// qa-sweep and qa-flows drive the REAL site with REAL device user agents — an
// iPhone Safari string, a desktop Chrome string — precisely so they exercise
// the paths a customer takes. That is what makes them useful, and it is also
// what makes them invisible to the bot filter on /api/events: they look exactly
// like people, because they are pretending to be people.
//
// So a sweep against production wrote runs of "visits" into product_events —
// landed on the site, started building a card, opened pricing — seconds apart,
// each on a fresh session. On the admin funnel that is indistinguishable from
// demand, and it lands on the top step, which is the denominator for every
// conversion rate below it.
//
// TWO markers, because there are two sinks (audit, 2026-09-23):
//   · localStorage `sc_evt_internal` — read by lib/events.ts and sent with
//     every product_events beacon.
//   · cookie `sc_internal` — read by /api/site-view (marketing pageviews) and,
//     since the audit, by /api/events as well.
// Setting only the first (as this did until 2026-09-23) left 3,206 of 3,842
// marketing pageviews labelled real, most of them our own nightly runs.
//
// Every script that opens a browser context must pass it through here —
// tests/qa-internal-marker.test.ts fails CI otherwise.
